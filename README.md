# BCF-to-PDF
Being unable to find any useful tools that convert the BIM collaboration format(BCF) file to an easily accesible format(for people with no knowledge of BCF such as Archiects or Engineers in industry) such as Excel or PDF. 

I tried the tool available on Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bcf2pdf/) but this tool misbehaves for all the test files I tried with. Hence, requesting for help to begin with the developement of a tool that actually works for this purpose.
